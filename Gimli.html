				<p>This here is Gimli, my closest companion. He loves going on hikes or lazying around the house from time to time, you never can tell what his mood will be.
				He's a white and tan mix of some breed that I'm not really sure about. I'm also not sure about his age. <br><br>
				You see, Gimli was adopted...</p>

				<p>I came across Gimli while browsing a Shelter's Website. His mugshot they had posted gave me convinced me enough to go ask about him. but once I saw him in person, I was hooked. He was the most energetic furball I had ever seen.
				It sadden me to hear how he ended up at the shelter in the first place, being abandoned and chained to a try by his original owner and given no name.<br><br>
				But I knew I would change his world and show him the love and care he deserved. </p>
